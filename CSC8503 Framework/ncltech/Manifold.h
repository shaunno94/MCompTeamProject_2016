Description:
A manifold is the surface area of the collision between two objects, which 
for the purpose of this physics engine also is used to solve all the contact
constraints between the two colliding objects.

This is done by applying a distance constraint at each of the corners of the surface
area, constraining the shapes to seperate in the next frame. This is also coupled with
additional constraints of friction and also elasticity in the form of a bias term.
